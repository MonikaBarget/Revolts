1509,1509,Various Riots,"The series extends down to 1844 / though the last volume (for 1840-1844) is beyond the scope of this catalogue. Though described on their covers as 'Sessions Books' / these volumes are in the nature of minute books / recording the proceedings of the court. Their nature is borne out by the later series of Sessions Minute Books beginning in 1778 and continuous from 1841: with the exception of the first two Minute Books (for 1778-1809 and March 1841-January 1845) / which appear to be drafts from which the Sessions Books were written up / the Minute Books from January 1845 are virtually indistinguishable from the later Sessions Books / which they supersede and continue as the main record of the court down to 1956. Most of the courts in the earliest Sessions Book (for 1509-1515) are described as 'Sessions of the Peace' only. Most subsequent Sessions are of the Peace and Gaol Delivery. Sessions of the Peace alone still appear in books 2-6 (C/2/9/1/1/8/2-6) for 1549-1616 / where the entries are similar to those of the composite Sessions except that the gaol calendars are usually omitted. Sessions of the Peace between January 1642 and October 1654 (C/2/9/1/1/8/7-8) deal mainly (in very brief entries) with cases of riot. 'Special Sessions' / October 1763-April 1775 (C/2/9/1/1/8/10) are for rating appeals only, and Sessions of the Peace / January 1819-September 1822 (C/2/9/1/1/8/12) are for orders for the relief of imprisoned debtors / diversion of highways and other administrative matters. Most of the entries in the first volume consist merely of lists of officers and grand jurors / and memoranda of recognizances for appearance or to keep the peace (the last rarely dated) made in or out of Sessions. In subsequent volumes the usual contents are: recognizances, grand jury lists, trial jury lists (1564-1815), calendars of prisoners with notes of process, and court orders (including those for discharging apprentices / 1564-1585, for bridge rates / 1692-1741, for the Marshalsea Treasurer's rates / 1741-1836, and for highway diversions from 1818). Lists of the overseers and collectors of the twelve parishes appear annually / 1577-1589 / and appointments of the Treasurers for the Sick and Wounded / with orders to them / 1593-1783. Lists of coroners / serjeants and bailiffs (or constables) of hamlets appear between 1549 and 1601 / and occasionally 1601-1616. Badgers' licences appear occasionally / 1564-1720, and alehouse licences occasionally / 1587-1616. The language of the record is mostly Latin down to 1652 / when English supersedes it until 1660. From the Restoration many entries are again in Latin until its abolition for legal purposes in 1731. From 1576 to 1651 the record of the Sessions Books is augmented by entries in the series of composite enrolments of the borough courts (C/2/10/1) which / for those criminal cases considered worthy of permanent enrolment / recite the process in full following each indictment.",#,context unclear,England,England,British Empire,Suffolk Record Office / Ipswich Branch C/2/9/1/1/8,#,#,#,#,#
