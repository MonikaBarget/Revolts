### Events

#### Table of selected (alleged / planned) unrest

The events listed took place in the British Isles and / or the American colonies and point to the strong cultural and political exchanges between the different parts of the Empire. The classifications of the events on the right-hand side give a general overview of the different motivations behind 18th-century uprisings although the factors mentioned are by no means exclusive. There were, in fact, many overlaps between religious / cultural, social / economic and political aims. 

The hyperlinks lead to external resources provoding additional background information. Whenever possible, articles in the Encyclopedia Britannica, (local) government websites or academic e-publications have been linked. In other cases, Wikipedia articles have been linked as a starting point for further research.

An **extended and fully searchable table** of violent conflicts in the British Empire and the independent United States between 1513 and 1819 can be viewed [here](https://github.com/MonikaBarget/Revolts/blob/master/TABLE_events_1513-1819.csv). The table is work in progress -- information on agents and outcomes may be missing, and the table is necessarily incomplete. The information given is based on several SPARQL queries relating to early-modern uprisings in Wikidata. SPARQL is a query language that permits complex searches in the entire Wikidata database.
