### Chronological table of (alleged / planned) unrest

<p>Different forms of unrest in the British Isles as well as the British colonies pointed to strong cultural and political exchanges between the different parts of the Empire. In a <a href="https://github.com/MonikaBarget/Revolts/blob/master/TABLE_events_1513-1819.csv" target="_blank"><strong>a fully searchable data table</strong></a>, I have assembled events of (alleged / planned) conflicts in the British Empire and the independent United States between 1513 and 1819. The table is work in progress -- information on agents and outcomes may be missing or dubitable. The information given is based on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/">SPARQL queries</a> in the <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/">Wikidata Query Service</a> as well as abstracts of archival items found in the <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">National Archives of the UK</a> online catalogue. The relevant Wikidata IDs and archival signatures have been added.</p>

<p>The <strong>thematic classification</strong> of the events on the right-hand side of the table gives a general overview of the different motivations that could drive 18th-century uprisings although the factors mentioned are by no means exclusive. There were, in fact, many overlaps between religious, cultural, social, economic and political aims. Therefore, the data table is meant as a starting point for further research.</p> 

<p>The selected events listed below are mentioned in my publications on political violence in the 18th century. The <strong>hyperlinks</strong> lead to external resources provoding preliminary background information. Articles in the Encyclopedia Britannica, (local) government websites or academic e-publications have been linked alongside Wikipedia entries.</p>
