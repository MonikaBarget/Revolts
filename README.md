### Uprisings in the eighteenth-century British Empire

This repository contains metadata analyses and visualisations relating to different types of political unrest in the eighteenth-century British Empire.

### Interactive map of uprisings (classified by insurrection type)

The interactive map is based on events found in print-publications of the eighteenth century as well as Wikidata and Wikipedia between 1500 and 1800. Different types of uprisings can be selected from the interactive menu. Although the events captured are far from complete, they highlight the geographic distribution of violent conflict across the early modern British Empire as well as the wide range of motivations behind them.
