They were originally intended for the Princes Dolgorukov, who are disgraced a second time and sent to Siberia. Czarina feared that gentlemen who visited them in their first exile might raise rebellion against her. Persian ambassador, now recalled, achieved nothing because it is said he would not treat on former instructions when he heard Prince Tamas was in posession of Ispahan, and may contract with Ottoman government to drive Russians out of province of Ghilan, desirable to both the Grand Seigneur and the Sophy, whose subjects had a great silk trade with that province, before Russian conquest which ruined it. In this event Russia might wage war on the Turks keeping them fully employed at home and unable to assist the Emperor. Duke of Liria annoyed that recall of Prince Scerbatov, the Russian minister in Spain, so secret. Obvious that Russia has taken this step only on the persuasion of Vienna. Duke says his king should recall him too. Count Wratislaw and Russians hindered by duke from assisting Emperor in case a war should break out. Plea for immediate character similar to that of Ward. Congratulations to Czarina would be kindly received by this court and a mortification to that of Vienna.","1730-06-29","2019-07-23 10:01:39","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","folio 132","","","","","UK SP 91/11","","","","","","Moscow","","","","The National Archives of the UK, Kew","State Papers Foreign: Russia","National Archive of the UK","UK SP 91/11","","","","http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C6720653","","","","","","Rondeau","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first one was not passed on to Hobbes, whereas the second one remained an unfinished draft. In his letters, Leibniz defends Hobbes against attacks that make no distinction between the abstract, general content of his theory and its application to concrete cases. On the other hand, Leibniz criticizes Hobbes as well. Against Hobbes' psychology, Leibniz contends that the idea of sense perception as a reaction that lingers on in the body is impossible without assuming the existence of a soul (which Hobbes denies). However, Leibniz misconstrues Hobbes' notion of reaction as actual motion instead of a tendency to motion, as Hobbes has it. Leibniz's further argument that material cohesion cannot be understood as a reaction to the impact of other bodies is also flawed since it only considers one body and not two, as is necessary for any reaction to take place.","2005","2019-07-23 10:02:15","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-02-27 20:53:22","147-160","","2","37","","Studia Leibnitiana","","","","","","","","de","","","","","JSTOR","","00000","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intention of this paper is to direct attention to and discuss these items, consisting of a series of passages in Leibniz's political and historical correspondence and a hitherto unnoticed eye-witness account of the Battle of the Boyne. The former, paraphrased in English, are incorporated in the text, whereas the latter is given in full translation. In presenting this material it is hoped to provide an insight into the interest of Leibniz, polyhistor and one of the greatest scholars of seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Europe, in Ireland and Irish civilisation.","1991","2019-07-23 10:02:15","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-02-27 21:10:26","1-20","","","91C","","Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Explains delay of his reply: he had to deal, as a matter of urgency, with a packet of papers received from Paget. Gives a precis of Paget's dispatch of Oct 2 [1693, see f.168, ante] and comments sharply on the raising of the siege of Belgrade. - Asks Cresset to thank the electoress Sophia for her appreciative interest in himself. - Describes his audience of the electoress of Saxony from her sick-bed. - There is a rumour of [Benoit Bidal, baron] d'Asfeld coming to Dresden 'to show favours'. At his, Stepney's, behest, Ilten sounded the elector, but is satisfied that d'Asfeld, 'that accomplice of [Sieur Barthélemy de Livières] Grandval' will get no encouragement. - To-day is 'Ausschuss-or Deputationstag', i.e. deputies of the political estates of the electorate will meet in committee, at which Gersdorff will propose a 'further supply' in the elector's name. Stepney does not think that the degree of their compliance will be 'proportionable' to the elector's 'wants or expectations'. - [Bodo von] Oberg [Hanoverian diplomat] is on his way to Vienna. PS. Warmly recommends [? William] Storer (see ff.11v and 33v, ante) whom Cresset has taken into his service and whom, he says, he has known for seven years. - Acknowledges letter of Jan 5. - The [French] peace proposal is justly ridiculed wherever it is considered, particularly by the electo [of Saxony]. - Regarding the 'inclinations of the elector of Bavaria, Leibniz will tell him, Cresset, what Stepney, when asked about his opinion, intimated to him ten months ago, namely 'I gave it for whoring.... He has something of King Charles's humour &amp; I believe for a mistriss would reject not only the Netherlands but even the reversion of the kingdome of Spain if France would offer that likewise as a bait for a peace...' .

Upon his return to Rome he narrowly escaped conviction for malfeasance in office, retired from public life, and took up historiography. Sallust's two extant monographs take as their theme the moral and political decline of Rome, one on the conspiracy of Catiline and the other on the war with Jugurtha. Although Sallust is decidedly unsubtle and partisan in analyzing people and events, his works are important and significantly influenced later historians, notably Tacitus. Taking Thucydides as his model but building on Roman stylistic and rhetorical traditions, Sallust achieved a distinctive style, concentrated and arresting; lively characterizations, especially in the speeches; and skill at using particular episodes to illustrate large general themes""--Publisher website","2013","2019-07-23 10:02:15","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","440","","","","","The war with Catiline","Sallust","I","","","Harvard University Press","Cambridge, MA/London","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","PA6653 .A2 2013","","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\P7A8MXJL\search.html","","Catiline; Conspiracy of Catiline, 65-62 B.C; History; Jugurthine War, 111-105 B.C; Republic, 265-30 B.C; Rome; Sallust","","","","Rolfe, John Carew; Ramsey, J.

While there have been many recent studies of the deist John Toland, the writings of other contemporary deists have been forgotten. With extensive analysis of lesser known figures such as Anthony Collins, Matthew Tindal, Thomas Chub, and Thomas Morgan, in addition to unique insights into Toland, *Deism in Enlightenment England * offers a much broader assessment of what deism entailed in the eighteenth century. Readers will see how previous interpretations of English deists, which place these figures on an irreligious trajectory leading towards modernity, need to be revised. This book uses deists to address a number of topics and themes and theme in English history and will be of particular interest to scholars of Enlightenment history, history of science, theology and politics, and the early modern era.","2009","2019-07-23 10:02:15","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-02-27 20:56:12","","","","","","","Deism in Enlightenment England","","","","","Manchester University Press","Manchester","","","","","","JSTOR","","00015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is why she analyses the ideology of royal supremacy in a wider context and goes back to the establishment of the 'reformed' English monarchy in the years 1530 to 1547. Then she continues to analyse the clashes of crown and parliament in the 17th century as well as the crown's relation to early-modern lawyers. The book finally describes the connections of spiritual authority and royal jurisdiction. The role of Anglican bishops is discussed alongside dissenting and anti-clerical movements in England. ""Hunting Hobbists"" (p. 221) is an especially provocative chapter on the suppression of political oppositions. And the final comments on ""papist caesaropapism"" (p. 229-274) under James II can also contribute to fervent discussions.","2011","2019-07-23 10:02:15","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","320","","","","","Godly Kingship","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(page 9) The author also tries to see the 1688 Revolution in the light of party politics, parliament and constitutional settlement and shows that the Glorious Revolution tackled questions which had already been resolved in the Pax Westfalica for continental Europe in the mid-17th century. (page 54) The book is especially useful as a basic introduction for graduate students.","1993","2019-07-23 10:02:15","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","","","","","","Politics under the later Stuarts","","","","","Longman","London","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\HWUVQJD8\search.html","","England; Political parties -- History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QV3Y597Z","book","1984","Clifton, Robin","The last popular rebellion: the western rising of 1685","","","","","","This book is a very important attempt to see the Monmouth Rebellion not just as a foreshadow of 1688, but rather as a turning point in the entire history of early modern British rebellions. In contrast to earlier studies, it especially focuses on the towns people and peasants who joined the Duke's army. The men supporting Monmouth came from many different social and professional groups and represented a new idea of government: a legitimate leader has to be ""the best men in the country""! page 287: It lay behind a statement made in a Portsmouth tavern during the rebellion, that the Duke 'had a great force (with him) ... and he was a true Protestant. Here emphasis fell upon the religious qualification, but Monmouth won support too because of his broader attributes. An Oxford boatman in 1683 called him 'the best man in the kingdom' in the context of talk concerning the Duke's right to the throne. This speaker may have heard CONTRACTUAL THEORIES of government argued by ables theorists than himself, for a Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, was accused of helping incite a pro-Monmouth riot in that town during April 1683 (to which the boatman quoted above also contributed), by making a remarkable statement in an Oxford tavern. (...) Contract theory had been the very essence of Leveller propaganda in the 1640s, and had reappeared during the Exclusion debates.""","1984","2019-07-23 10:02:15","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","","","","","","The last popular rebellion","","","","","Maurice Temple Smith,","London","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\LDP2T3T7\search.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Br. 24 Äußere Angelegenheiten wurde in der Zeit von März bis August 1948 von dem Angestellten Lathwesen unter Leitung des Unterzeichneten neu verzeichnet, nachdem das alte Findbuch infolge Bombenangriffs im Oktober 1943 durch Brand vernichtet worden war. Dieser Bestand überschneidet sich in vielen Fällen mit der Abteilung Hann. 9 (Ministerium der Äußeren Angelegenheiten), so dass beide Designationen nebeneinander bearbeitet werden müssten. Allerdings ist der größte Teil von Hann. 9 während des Krieges 1939/45 durch Feindeinwirkung vernichtet worden. Die Unterabteilung Österreich ist im Gegensatz zu sämtlichen anderen Abteilungen nach Sachbetreffen in sich unterteilt und dementsprechend in einem eigenen Band des Findbuches, allerdings in der alphabetischen Reihenfolge des Gesamtbestandes, vereinigt. Die Hauptmasse dieser Designation bilden Akten der regierenden Fürsten und der Geheimen Räte zu Hannover, denen indessen auch andere Provenienzen (Handakten der Minister und Gesandten) angeschlossen wurden. In der Abteilung Österreich ist außerdem noch das außerordentlich wertvolle Archiv der hannoverschen Gesandtschaft in Wien enthalten. Bei der Neuordnung dieses umfangreichen Bestandes, an der mehrere Hände mitgewirkt haben, sind außerdem noch aus anderen Aktenabteilungen einzelne Faszikel herausgelöst und hier eingegliedert worden, da sie sich inhaltsmäßig in den bereits vorhanden gewesenen Akten einfügen. Neu aufgenommen in dieses Findbuch wurden von Staatsarchiv-Referendar Dr. Mundhenke bearbeitete Regesten von Urkunden, deren Abschriften bei der Verzeichnung festgestellt wurden. (In der Abt. Österreich befinden sich solche Abschriften). Bei genauer Durchsicht der Aktenstücke würden sich sicherlich noch weitere Urkundenabschriften vorfinden. Infolge Zeitmangels war dieses jedoch unter den gegenwärtigen Verhältnissen nicht möglich. Die Regesten wurden in einem chronologischen Verzeichnis der besseren Übersicht wegen zusammengefaßt.

They can also include private and official letters, musters, reports, commissions and instructions, council orders and correspondence, memoranda and draft parliamentary bills. The state papers were frequently treated as private property by some secretaries of state who incorporated 'state papers' into their own private collections.

There are some gaps before 1702, but from that date the series is almost complete. They have an internal filing order, beginning with indictments brought into court on writs of certiorari, then Middlesex indictments, presentments, informations by the master of the Crown Office and informations ex officio. The files do not include a very large amount of London material, and what there is consists of indictments brought into King's Bench on writs of certiorari and informations. It may be that London was included in the same file as Middlesex because of the similar lengths of the periods during which writs had to be returned to the court; it bore the same relationship to King's Bench as other counties. The Middlesex material includes presentments made by petty constables, including those for the liberty of Westminster, to two grand juries, one for Ossulstone hundred and one for the rest of the county, for minor offences; indictments in the first instance, mostly cases of assault rather than felonies, received as a result of the court's overriding jurisdiction in the county by virtue of its residence there; indictments, recognizances, special verdicts and summary convictions removed from inferior jurisdictions under certiorari; and criminal informations, especially informations by the master of the Crown Office and by the attorney general (informations ex officio).","1675","2019-07-23 10:01:39","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","","","","","","KB 10","","","","","","London","en","","file(s)","The National Archives of the UK, Kew","Record of the Court of King's Bench and other courts: Crown side records","","","","","","http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C10014","","","","","","Court of King's Bench","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has also published monographs from time to time. Its publications can be found in the major British and American public and university libraries: they are also available for purchase by individuals. The society is managed by its officers and a council representing the British historical community. When Sir Geoffrey Elton and others founded the Society in 1965, its aim was to meet an immediate need by publishing and distributing ‘photographic copies of unprinted lists and indexes kept in the Public Record Office, London, and of other unprinted guides and aids to the use of public archives in the British Isles', so that historians working at a distance from London could find out what was available in advance of their visits. As the Society nears its half-century, the dissemination of lists and indexes in facsimile has been replaced by the online catalogue. In these very different circumstances, the Society continues to serve the historical community by publishing texts, editions and tabulations of historical manuscripts that are outside the range of the online catalogue, but judged to be unremunerative by academic and other presses.","1981","2019-07-23 10:01:39","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","","","","","","State Papers Domestic","","","","","Swift Printers","London","English","","","","","","","","","","","diplomacy; England; Great Britain; intelligence; Ireland; proclamation; Scotland; state papers; Wales","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On page 49, the author condemns George I as an inefficient ruler, but like many other anglophone researchers, he totally neglects that being German is more than 'not being able to speak English'. It implies different training as a ruler and different perceptions of monarchical rule.

The print series, edited by David C.

It has over the years become an indispensable resource for generations of students, researchers and lecturers. EHD is now available in its entirety online. Bringing EHD into the digital age has been a long and complex process. To provide you with first-rate, intelligent searchability, Routledge have teamed up with the Institute of Historical Research (one of the research institutes that make up the School of Advanced Study, University of London http://www.history.ac.uk) to produce EHD Online. The IHR's team of experts have fully indexed the documents, using an exhaustive historical thesaurus developed by the Royal Historical Society for its Bibliography of British and Irish History. The sources include treaties, statutes, declarations, government and cabinet proceedings, military dispatches, orders, acts, sermons, newspaper articles, pamphlets, personal and official letters, diaries and more.

Not all of these examinations have reacted to Davis's clarion call to heed the influence of religion in everyday life, but they should nonetheless be considered as they have helped to develop a better understanding of early modern violence as well as to inform more recent studies of religious violence.3 One aspect of this research has questioned the grand narrative of Norbert Elias's ‘civilizing process’ and the evidence for a decline in violence in the early modern period. The transformation of the duel might be regarded as indicative of this process as it changed from being a judicial and public encounter to a private means of resolving disputes which was subject to increasing anti-duelling legislation. In recent studies, however, duelling has been seen together with feuding and revenge killings as matters of honour with their own particular codes and royal recognition that legitimized this particular form of private violence and distinguished it from that of the unruly mob. The noble caste through their martial education and upbringing remained attuned to the demands of warfare. But this is a picture that was further complicated by the religious developments of the sixteenth century that established, and through royal edicts legitimized, religious difference and co-existence.

"Q37ANLMJ","book","2003","Shagan, Ethan H.","Popular Politics and the English Reformation","","978-0-521-52555-8","","","","This book is a study of popular responses to the English Reformation. It takes as its subject not the conversion of English subjects to a new religion but rather their political responses to a Reformation perceived as an act of state and hence, like all early modern acts of state, negotiated between government and people. These responses included not only resistance but also significant levels of accommodation, co-operation and collaboration as people attempted to co-opt state power for their own purposes. This study argues, then, that the English Reformation was not done to people, it was done with them in a dynamic process of engagement between government and people. As such, it answers the twenty-year-old scholarly dilemma of how the English Reformation could have succeeded despite the inherent conservatism of the English people, and it presents a genuinely post-revisionist account of one of the central events of English history.","2003","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","364","","","","","Popular politics","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: MiiTzO6NsdMC","","","https://books.google.de/books?id=MiiTzO6NsdMC","#TudorEngland","History / Europe / Great Britain; History / Europe / Western; History / Renaissance; Political Science / Political Process / General; Religion / Christian Theology / General; Religion / History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FIVYWA4H","book","2011","Oates, Jonathan D.","The Jacobite Campaigns: the British State at War","","","","","","""The military aspects of the Jacobite campaigns in eighteenth-century Britain are considered in this study. Taken from the viewpoint of those loyal to the Hanoverian Crown, the three mailnland campaigns of 1715-16, 1719 and 1745-6 are examined, using research based on primary sources: memories, diaries, letters, newspapers and state papers. Oates looks at how the eighteenth-century military machine operated in a domestic context, as well as its effectiveness. Such a focus adds a new dimension to the study of this period, and allows for further questions as to the uniqueness of the Jacobite rebellions."" In his introduction, Oates especially criticizes that Scottish history in the 18th century is generally judged by the fatal episodes of Mary Queen of Scots and Jacobitism alone. And at the same time, he wishes to see British troops in a new light. 18th century warfare in general was much better coordinated and more considerate than popular reports on brutal militia, amateur officer and helplessness in the face of Indians and patriotic rebels will allow. Oates justly attacks the image of the British troops formed by modern cinema in films such as ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""The Patriot"".

The Stuart prince and the rising associated with him have accordingly become very familiar to many who know little else about British history.  Yet nearly thirty years previously there was a larger, potentially much more threatening, Jacobite revolt against the Hanoverian regime.  From September 1715 to February 1716 most of Scotland and, for a time, parts of northern England rose in arms against the political order that had prevailed since 1688.  Two major battles were fought, one on Sheriffmuir near Dunblane and another on the streets of Preston in Lancashire, in which well over a thousand lives were lost.  In the aftermath dozens of captured rebels were executed, hundreds more transported to be sold into indentured servitude in the American and Caribbean colonies, northern Scotland was comprehensively looted and the Catholic community in northern England was judicially ransacked and intimidated. And it is the '15 that is the subject of my latest book, 1715.  The Great Jacobite Rising (Yale University Press, 2006).  It takes in all three kingdoms and the Jacobite diaspora in Europe with a view to exploring how the rebels persuaded themselves that they had come to the right time and place to overthrow the prevailing political order, and the fundamental social dynamics of the rebellion, in terms of who commanded, who obeyed and why they thought challenging the military might of the contemporary British state was feasible.  I also investigated the processes of creating a shadow-state in rebel-held areas and how the Jacobites trained and armed their troops.  The proof of the pudding in war is, though, who wins and who loses, so I also took a close look at the military clashes which gave the rising its beginning and end.  Taken in the round, there is nothing that better exposes the pathology of a society than upheaval and the shattering of verities, and, in particular, the way civil order is reasserted in its aftermath can tell us a great deal about how the machine worked.  Hence that is where the book concludes, with an analysis of the reknitting of the social order once the war was over.","2013","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2014-03-24 23:47:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\7QSQQK57\danielszechi.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7SRJSSDC","book","1939","Tayler, Alistair Norwich; Tayler, Helen Agnes Henrietta","The Stuart papers at Windsor : being selections from hitherto unprinted royal archives","","","","","","This collection covers both the 1715 and the 1745 rebellions, but there is a special focus on the Earl of Mar and Queen Clementina. Possibly the most exciting letter in this collection is a printing demand send by Prince Charles Edward to ""Edgar"", ten days before he started for Scotland: ""I send you here also enclosed an authenthick copy of what is to be printed & dispersed at my landing."" Another very exciting letter is a touching fatherly address by James Francis to his son, written on April 12, 1746 (page 168): ""I will not deprieve myself of the satisfaction of writing to you at least every week, My Dearest Carluccio, tho' I am still without that of hearing directly from you. (...) tho' the truth is, it is very hard for any thing or any body to come to you, now that you are upon your retreat, and that it is not known where you may be. (...) My chief concern at present is for you personal safety, but I trust in God he will always preserve and protect you, whatever may happen."" The next letter, written on May 30, 1746, refers to uncertain news of the Battle of Culloden and shows James Francis's increased concern for his son, and his growing disappointed in the French and Spanish. ""There is something incomprehensible in the conduct of the Court of France in that particular that I am tyred of thinking of it and I shall say no more of it here, but that I still hope you will be allowed to make it, if you are not better emplayed, and that in all events, after all that is past, all the world must see that you have done your part, and in that respect we may rest satisfied."" (p. 170) The Pretender's idea of loyalty among (Catholic) rulers and his diplomatic values seem to contrast with the opportunism of the French court, while he is still fully convinced of his family's duty to labour for the best interest of Great Britain: ""The happiness of our Country must undoubtedly be your motive, and by consequence you would never surely restrict that happiness to your own life only, but endeavour to perpetuate it by a succession of Lawful Kings, who may have no other interest but those of Our Country."" (Letter to Prince Charles on December 30, 1750, page 217)  James Francis generally shows great love for the Scots in particular, but whenever he talks of politics in more universal terms, he always refers to England AND Scotland as ""Our Country"". His sons ""way of living"" in 1750 and the lack of wife and heir for Charles Edward deeply worries James Francis and threatens the family tradition also in moral respects. The growing division between father and son, however, is countered by positive events such as the conversion of Lord Dunbar to Catholicism, which is cheerfully announced to James Edgar on September 23, 1751 (page 219), ""hoping that the news would give his Majesty some pleasure, on account of the goodness yr Majesty was pleased to show me during the course of many years which I had the honour to pass in your service."" This again reveals how individual and culturally relevant rather than politically effective Jacobitism after 1746 was. Men still adhering to it after the Battle of Culloden probably saw it as a way to reconcile a life style which was not considered ""English"" at home with their own true love for their home country. This outlook may have helped to bring about Catholic Relief and Catholic Emancipation on the long run, granting non-Anglican believes a proper place within English society. At the same time, later Jacobitism was marked by a decisive new internationalism, wittily expressed in Lord Dunbar's own writing: ""It is certaine that we whome providence has conducted into Catholique countrys and obliged to live and probably to dy in them are of all me the most unexcusable if we neglect to examine seriously the grounds of the separation of our ancestors from the Universal church, and a serious examen can never divert you from the truth if you are in the right way, because, as you well know besides the force of truth itself education, habit and in spite of all resolutions to the contrary a strong prevention on their side."" (page 219) For further study, it will be necessary and interesting to look at the definitions of ""the Royal Cause"" given by Sir Richard Warren, Major General to James Francis, too. In a letter from Vannes on May 6, 1760, he thanked James Francis for granting him new military commission even though this might not be put into action. (page 252) So how did he see his role in Jacobitism? And what purpose did it all serve as late as 1760? The final section of the book (APPENDIX) is dedicated to petitions to the ""King in Rome"" and how James Francis dealt with them. It is interesting that people actually expected support from a king without a crown, and this communication may shed further light on the strong personal ties between the Stuarts and their supporters. Especially in comparison to the American Revolution, the petitions may reveal a general demand for broader participation in political procedures of the time, and they might also reveal people's displeasure with law enforcement and the execution of justice at home. Strong and efficient PARALLEL STRUCTURES of legislature and justice were one of the main causes for the successful American Independence. This is why the petitions to James Francis Stuart are well worth looking at.","1939","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","ix, 290 p. : frontis., ports. ; 22 cm.

The exhibition was sponsored by famous Scottish whisky company 'Drambuie' because they date their whisky-based liqueur back to Prince Charles Edward Stuart (page 6). Drambuie finance both research and collecting in order to re-assess Jacobitism within British and European politics and culture. Edward Corp's exhibition catalogue, however, does not give any new or exciting interpretations of the Stuart portraits from Italy and France. Corp's text is a thorough study of the timeframe of portrait production in exile - and it states how difficult it often is to attribute a particular painting to one of the many artists engaged by the Stuart family; but the political iconography of the official Stuart portraits and the variations in content and style which mark the cheaper copies circulated all across Europe are not described suffienctly. Edward Corp rather dwells on the popular attraction exerted by the ""romance, the heroism (...) and the ultimate tragedy of Scotland's exiled royal family"".

These contained a series of direct attacks on whig propaganda, but are without the female narrative frames or striking female protagonists that are her trade mark in prose fiction and drama. (...) Manley's liaison with the Jacobite printer and alderman of the City of London John Barber may have begun as early as 1705  when he published her Queen Zarah. (...) With Queen Anne's death in 1714 and the decline of tory hopes, Manley seems to have turned away from partisan publication without losing her relish for scandal. (...)

Nombre de Jacobites s'illustrent partout en Europe comme généraux, négociateurs, hommes d'Etat, banquiers, commerÇants.

Asch stresses some modern, open-minded tendencies of the Stuart court life in exile, e.g. the intense contact with Protestant theologians. Furthermore, Charles Edward Stuart did not approve of his brother Henry's decision to become a priest and cardinal. For Charles Edward, a good accord with the Protestant Englishmen was a necessary basis for his attempts to regain the British crown. And he was very well aware that Great Britain could never be converted to Catholicism again. This is why Daniel Szechi, too, may have a point in seeing the jacobites as witty diplomats and true 'Europeans'. And most of the recent literature on the Stuarts in seems to share this very positive view. The ways in which the jacobites interpreted rebellion, legitimate resistance and a proper state constitution, however, are hardly ever discussed.","2011","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","126 pages : illustrations (black and white) ; 18 cm.","","","","","Stuarts","","","","","Verlag C.H.

"T7YUQELS","book","1941","","Jacobite Epilogue. A Further Selection of Letters from Jacobites among the Stuart papers at Windsor. Published by the Gracious Permission of His Majesty the King, edited, with an introduction by Henrietta Tayer, F.R.Hist.S.","","","","","","This collection of letters focuses on the aftermath of the fatal 1745 rebellion and especially aims to display the negative influence of Irish advisors on Charles Edward and the Prince's own inability to accept and communicate his loss to his supporters. The letters focus on the adherents' petitions and expressions of loyalty rather than the responses given by James Francis and Charles Edward, which is why the overall impression is that of a very one-sided, increasingly disappointed contact. Considering the 'long-durée' effects, this collection outlines the failure of Jacobitism as a story of personal inability and mismanagement, but I rather feel that the problems of miscommunication after 1745 were not foreseeable as such. James Francis did very well in his international networking through many private letters and a very efficient 'royal performance' even though he may not have been a viliant military leader. His son Charles Edward had the opposite qualities but could rely on his father's friends. This is why personal weaknesses on either side may have mattered much less than the editors of many Jacobite letters wish to suggest. Instead of a complete failure, the later Jacobite movement must rather be described as a matter of transformation. After 1746, it was no longer a military movement and maybe not even a monarchical movement. The centre of attention shifted from the Pretender and the Prince towards cultural and constitutional matters. And this shift has certainly proved even more fruitful for the idea of opposition in England and Scotland than the ealier attempts to restore the Stuart monarchy by force. Especially the letters by Lord George Murray written after Aprul 17, 1746, are very revealing for this cause (cf. pages 63 etc.). The most important letter expressing James Francis's feelings and helplessness after Culloden was written on January 20, 1747, and addressed to John Cameron Lochiel (page 133 and 134). Evidence of ciphered letters is given on pages 132 and 133, which contain a letter from Lochiel to the Prine in February 1745. In this letter, the address ""YRH"" as well as references to place, time and people involved in the uprising are given as a number code.","1941","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","331","","","","","Jacobite Epilogue","","","","","Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.","London, Edinburgh, Paris, Melbourne, Toronto and New York","en","","","","","","","","","","","Rebellion; Scotland; Jacobite; Stuart; 1745","","Tayler, Henrietta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7DQWXJ5D","book","1930","","Jacobite letters to Lord Pitsligo 1745-1746. Preserved at Fettercairn House, edited with notes by Alistair and Henrietty Tayler","","","","","","This volumes contains the correspondence of Jacobite Lords in Scotland. The major themes of their letters are: 1. seeking military support (abroad) 2. protecting the Prince against procalamtions of apprehension by King George II (reward for catching Charles Edward dead or alive) 3. raising money among fellow Scotsmen for a march into England 4. justifying their levying of ""civil war"" A letter from October 4, 1745, reveals that the Jacobites were just as afraid of assassins and religious fanatics as the Hanoverians were (page 34), and letters from Charled Edward to his officers show the emphasis generally placed on ""the Rules and Discipline of war"" by 18th century aristocratic armies (page 38). An interesting piece is the French perspective on the war given in the ""Declaration of Lord John Drummond, Commander in chief of his most Christian Majesties forces in Scotland"", which addresses Charles Edward only as ""Regent of Scotland"" and declares ""England"" the enemy. (page 47) This idea of a war of two nations may not have pleased the majority of Jacobites, who tended to consider the rebellion a ""civil war"" for just succession within Britain. In a letter to Lord Pitsligo on January 23, 1746, Dr. Leechman, Professor at Glasgow, adopted the idea of a 'civil war' as follows: ""From what I know of your Lordship's character I am persuaded that you are fully sensible of the many unavoidable calamities of a Civil war and that you will prevent all such miseries as may be avoided. I hope that the distress which the detaining these four deserving young men may occasion to themselves, to their relations and those with whom they are connected will prevail with you to use your Interest for their speedy release."" (page 49) The practice of petitioning for prisoners of war is further described in a letter by Reverend James Robb from Kilsyth to Lord Pitsligo in January 1746. (page 51) In a letter dated February 1746, Lord George Murray refers to the King's troops as ""the enemy"" in a very rational and unemotional report to Lord Pitsligo. (page 53) Besides, George Murray shows great concern for the local population: ""If your Lop. approve of it I would pay a reasonable price for carages & indeavour to save the poor peoples horse as much as possible."" (page 57)  This links the Jacobites very much to the American Revolutionaries and their strong local support in New England. In late February, the Scots hear of 4000 Hessians being in Leith road ""by Letters intercepted"". (page 65) Problems of cash and supplies shortly before the crucial Battle of Culloden are mentioned in pages 72 and 73! Even though soldiers could not be paid in cash, however, receipts were carefully kept and the military leaders were eager to ""assure the proprietors that his R.H. will pay them so soon as the state of affairs will permit."" (page 73) Lord Pitsligo to John Murray, February 26, 1746: ""Circumstances must determine whether we shall make head against the Enemy, or make an honourable Retreat should they advance upon us with a superior force."" (page 75) John Murray on February 28, 1746: ""I believe it might be very necessary to have a quantity of straw and fire provided in case the Prince send any more troops his way, but without a certainty I should be sorry to harass the country too much."" (page 78) VERY IMPORTANT, page 85: ""The following account of a Court Martial held at Elgin is curious as showing that even in this time of stress (March 1746), proper military procedure and discipline in the Prince's army were still maintained."" page 93: transferring prisoners savely to Inverness ... ""for we do not know how long we will be eable to keep this post"". Lord Pitsligo's answer to Sir Thomas Sheridan from Elgin, April 8, 1746: ""There were fifteen horses more sent from this place today recommended to that Coll; which is such a burden upon this Country that a great many of the Farmers will be incapacitated from tilling their ground their familys consequently reduced to Beggary. I'm sure it was allways the Prince's intention (since hardships must be) that none should suffer beyond their proportion (...) and every body wishes that orders of any consequence were only given to such persons as are acquainted with the laws of the Country."" (page 113) Sir Thomas Sheridan to Lord Pitsligo, April ye 9th, 1746: ""My Lord, Yr. Ldp. nor no body else need doubt but H.R.H. is concern'd at any dammage done in a country which he came not to oppress but set free. Yet still it must be remembered that War always carrys such accidents along with it and tho' H.R.H. wou'd never be persuaded to allow of such things, yet his ennemies cou'd have no just reason to complain if he did, considering with what barbarity the Elector's forces and Partizans have treated our friends, by burning the houses and stripping the women and children wherever they could come."" (page 115) IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON CENSORSHIP OF PRO-GOVERNMENT LETTERS BY JACOBITE LEADERS: page 116. Equally important: page 120 and 121: Lady Dunbar wishes to travel to Aberdeen, occupied by the Duke of Cumberland. Fearing that she might ""give intelligence"", Lord Pitsligo hinders her journey and only upon her promise not to reveal military details, she receives permission to travel in early April 1746.  The last letter of the present collection was written on APRIL 11, 1746, FROM SPEYMOUTH and anticipates battle with the ""enemy"" (page 124). Cumberland's army crossed the Spey on that day without opposition. Charles Edward had obviously hoped to ""dispute the passage of the river"", but Lord George Murray was against it. There is no attempt of negotiation on either side. ""Upon the 12th and 13th of April Cumberland's army quartered on the west side of the spey, on Lord Braco's lands (and Lord Braco, in spite of his Whig principles, afterwards made an extensive claim for damages)."" (page 126) On April 15, the Highlanders made their fatal attempt to overcome Cumberland's troops at Culloden.","1930","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","Milne & Hutchison","Aberdeen","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tayler, Alistair Norwich; Tayler, Henrietta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Blaikie was a recognized authority on the history of Jacobitism, and his collection of 1,076 printed items in 756 volumes, 42 manuscripts, three charters and c. 400 engravings relate to the attempts of the House of Stuart to reinstate itself on the throne of Great Britain. There is a good representation of polemical pamphlet literature on the controversy over the birth of James IIýs son in 1689, and the associated political questions of allegiance and legitimacy; historical works on the course of the Risings of 1715 and 1745 are complemented by contemporary poems, satires and sermons, many in French; and there are accounts of the trials, executions and expropriations that followed both Risings with the Government viewpoint recorded in the numerous Session Papers and Acts of Parliament concerned with these matters. There are also 22 portfolios of engravings of the Royal House of Stuart - portraits, views, broadsides, and caricatures - which have been placed by the National Library on long-term deposit in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

The basic narrative and prevalent interpretation of its significance were established by the late Geoffrey Holmes in his monograph The Trial of Doctor Sacheverell published in 1973. Holmes placed it in the context of a crisis in Church and state brought about by the Glorious Revolution and its aftermath. This led to the formation of the party conflict between high church tories and low church whigs. When the whigs, led by the junto, came to power between 1708 and 1710, their ascendancy provoked a reaction from tories claiming that the established Church was in danger. It was in this context that Sacheverell preached his provocative sermon on 5 November 1709, which brought on his impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanours. Holmes's detailed account of the trial, together with his separate analysis of the 'Sacheverell riots', have been generally accepted as definitive. Consequently, scholarly attention has tended to shift to the cultural aspects of the affair such as poems on affairs of state and political prints. These investigations have led, in turn, to attempts to establish an appropriate methodology for analysing their significance.","2012","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-01-26 23:35:19","16-27","","1: February","31","","Parliamentary History (Wiley-Blackwell)","Current State","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","00002","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\3AZ2ZBE4\Speck_2012_The Current State of Sacheverell Scholarship.pdf","","#SacheverelleRiots","deists; dissenters; DISSENTERS -- Great Britain; GREAT Britain -- Church history -- 18th century; GREAT Britain -- History -- Revolution of 1688; high church; low church; NONJURORS; occasional conformity; revolution (of 1688); RIOTS -- England -- History; SACHEVERELL, Henry; tories; TORY Party (Great Britain) -- History -- 18th century; WHIG Party (Great Britain) -- History -- 18th century; whigs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sacheverell's attack on the revolution of 1688, and the principles which underpinned it, allows us to question how far, 20 years later, a whig revolution had prevailed. The articles suggest that the revolution continued to be contested; that in 1710 the high church tory vision temporarily triumphed; that the flood of print showed the importance of religious dispute in shaping the public sphere; that the debate over Sacheverell connected Westminster and the public, not just in England but also in Ireland; that there was an important disagreement between high and low church about how to respond to the press's licentiousness, part of a story about the shift away from prepublication censorship towards regulation of print and copyright; that the print controversy over the trial was vituperative, 'impolite' and traded lies and misrepresentations; that Sacheverell's critics sought to associate him with harlots in a bid to suggest that his strong influence over women was unhealthy; that Sacheverell, on the other hand, deliberately depicted himself as a martyr; and that, for all its religious heat, 1710 was also important for an early enlightenment debate about political economy, since the tory vision on Church and state also embraced a reoriented foreign policy and that this contest over imperial visions had important consequences for the development of the colonies after 1714.","2012","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-01-26 23:34:10","1-15","","1: February","31","","Parliamentary History (Wiley-Blackwell)","Introduction","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","http://www.redi-bw.de/db/ebsco.php/search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dhlh%26AN%3d92678112%26site%3dehost-live","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\JX7EZPT4\Knights_2012_Introduction.pdf","","#SacheverelleRiots","Ireland; gender; Sacheverell; GREAT Britain -- History -- Revolution of 1688; SACHEVERELL, Henry; censorship; CENSORSHIP -- Great Britain -- History; early enlightenment; empire; Glorious Revolution; GREAT Britain -- Colonies -- History; GREAT Britain -- History -- Anne, 1702-1714; GREAT Britain -- History -- William & Mary, 1689-1702; ideology; moderation; political economy; press; PRESS & politics -- History; PUBLIC sphere","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the age of 22 he set up business in New England, before settling in Glasgow, where he traded tobacco for iron ore. He also engaged in the slave trade and in finance. He was very successful as a merchant, and in 1707 purchased the estate of Shawfield or Schawfield, in Rutherglen, from Sir James Hamilton. He also came to possess the valuable estate of Woodhall, near Holytown. A follower of the Duke of Argyll, he represented Inverary in the Scottish parliament from 1702 till the union, and was one of the commissioners who signed the treaty. He also sat in the first Parliament of Great Britain, 1707-8, and represented the Glasgow burghs from 1716 to 1734. In 1711 he built, for his town residence in Glasgow, Shawfield mansion, which became famous in connection with the Shawfield riots in 1725. Campbell had voted for the imposition of the malt tax in Scotland, and on this account the mob, after taking possession of the city and preventing the officers of excise from collecting it, proceeded to the Shawfield mansion and completely demolished the interior. The provost and magistrates were arrested on the ground of having favoured the mob, and Campbell received £9,000 from the city as compensation for the damages caused by the riot. Soon afterwards he purchased the island of Islay, the sum obtained from the city forming a large part of the money paid for it. Campbell's biography A very canny Scot was written by Joanna Hill and Nicholas Bastin, and published in 2007.","1726","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","[2],553-556p. ; 2⁰.","","","","","Act","","","","","John Baskett; and Thomas Norris, assignee to George Hills","London","English","","","Copac","","Copac","","","","","","#ShawfieldRiots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hector St. John de Crèvecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer (1782), and Washington Irving's ""Rip Van Winkle"" (1819-20), Steven Blakemore breaks new ground in assessing the strategies of subversion and intertextuality used during the American Revolution. Blakemore also crystallizes the historical contexts that link these works together – contexts that have been missed or overlooked by critics and scholars. The five works additionally illuminate issues of history (The Norman Conquest, the English Civil War, and the French Revolution) and gender as they impinge on American-revolutionary discourse. The result is five new readings of significant revolutionary-era works that suggest fruitful entries into other literatures of the Revolution. Blakemore demonstrates the nexus between literature and history in the revolutionary era and how it created an intertextual dialogue in the formation of the first postcolonial critiques of the British Empire.","2012-08-31","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","161","","","","","Literature, Intertextuality, and the American Revolution","","","","","Fairleigh Dickinson University Press","Madison [N.J.]","en","","","","","Google Books","","00000","","","https://books.google.ie/books?id=5UeSBAAAQBAJ","#AmericanRevolution","History / Revolutionary; History / Social History; History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800); Literary Criticism / American / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"V92JR23R","book","1775","","A Bloody butchery by the British Troops, or, The runaway fight of the regulars","","","","","","Being the PARTICULARS of the VICTORIOUS BATTLE fought at and near CONCORD, situated Twenty Miles from Boston, in the Providence of the Massachusetts-Bay, between Two Thousand Regular Troops, belonging to His Britannic Majesty, and a few Hundred Provincial Troops, belonging to the Province of Massachusetts-Bay, which lasted from sunrise until sunset, on the 19th of April, 1775, when it was decided greatly in favor of the latter. These particulars are published in this cheap form, at the request of the friends of the deceased WORTHIES, who died gloriously fighting in the CAUSE OF LIBERTY and their COUNTRY, and it is their sincere desire that every Householder in the country, who are sincere well-wishers to America, may be possessed of the same, either to frame and glass, or otherwise to preserve in their houses, not only as a Token of Gratitude to the memory of the Deceased Forty Persons, but as a perpetual memorial of that important event, on which, perhaps, may depend the future Freedom and Greatness of the Commonwealth of America. To which is annexed a Funeral Elegy on those who were slain in the Battle.  ON Tuesday evening the eighteenth instant, a body of soldiers under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, to the amount of about eight hundred men, embarked from Barton's Point in Boston, about eleven o'clock, crossed Charles-River, landed at Phips's-Farm, in Cambridge, and marched immediately up to Lexiington, near twelve miles from Boston; at sunrise they observing between thirty and forty inhabitants exercising near the meeting-house, the Commanding-Officer ordered them to lay down their arms and disperse, which not being directly complied with he ""demanded them for a pack of rebels,"" ordered his men to fire upon them, and killed eight men upon the spot, besides wounding several more. The army then proceeded to Concord, drew up on the parade, near the meeting-house, during which time the inhabitants from the neighboring towns collected and took possession of the adjacent hills; about eleven o'clock the firing began on both sides, which lasted near an hour, when the regular troops began to retreat, the provincials closely pursuing them to a bridge at a small distance, which the regulars took up as they passed; they then renewed the fire, and some were slain on both sides; but the regulars still retreated, and the provincials pursued them down to Lexington, where the regulars, about three o'clock in the afternoon, met with a reinforcement of about twelve hundred men commanded by Earl Percy, with two brass field pieces; they again renewed the attack upon the provincials, but soon thought proper further to retreat towards their head-quarters, the provincials pursued them into Charlestown, where they arrived at 6 o'clock; taking immediately, an advantageous post on Bunker's Hill, about a mile from the ferry; the provincials now discontinued the pursuit. The loss on either side we have not yet been able to ascertain, but it is said about one hundred regulars were killed and fifty wounded among which were several officers: Two officers and a number of soldiers were taken prisoners. On the part of the province, we hear that thirty-five were slain, and several wounded. The above is as particular an account of the engagement, as can at this time be collected, in the present confused state of the province. We hear an officer and his servant, with two pair of pistols, were yesterday taken and secured by our people, at Roxbury, on their way to Castle-William. SALEM, April 25. LAST Wednesday, the nineteenth of April, the troops of his Britannic Majesty commenced hostilities upon the people of this province, attended with circumstances of cruelty not less brutal than what our venerable Ancestors received from the vilest savages of the wilderness. The particulars relative to this interesting event, by which we are involved in all the horrors of a civil war, we have endeavored to collect as well as the present confused state of affairs will admit. On Thursday evening a detachment from the army, consisting, it is said, of eight or nine hundred men, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, embarked at the bottom of the common in Boston, on board a number of boats, and landed at Philips's-farm, a little way up Charles-River, from whence they proceeded with silence and expedition, on their way to Concord, about twenty miles from Boston. The people were soon alarmed, and began to assemble, in several towns, before day-light, in order to watch the motion of the troops. At Lexington, six miles below Concord, a company of militia, of about one hundred men, mustered near the meeting-house; the troops came in sight of them just before sunrise; and running within a few rods of them, the Commanding-Officer accosted the militia in words to this effect: --""Disperse you rebels --Damn you throw down your arms and disperse;' Upon which the troops huzza'd, and immediately one or two officers discharged their pistols, which were instantaneously followed by the firing of four or five of the soldiers, and then there seemed to be a general discharge from the whole body. Eight of our men were killed, and nine wounded. In a few minutes after this action the enemy renewed their march for Concord; at which place they destroyed several carriages, carriage-wheels, and about twenty barrels of flour, all belonging to the province. Here about one hundred men, going towards a bridge, of which the enemy were in possession, the latter fired, and killed two of our men, who then returned the fire, and obliged the enemy to retreat back to Lexington, where they met Lord Percy, with a large reinforcement, with two pieces of cannon. The enemy now having a body of about eighteen hundred men made a halt, picked up many of their dead, and took care of their wounded. At Menotomy, a few of the men, belonging to the detachment from Lynn-End, attacked a party of twelve of the enemy (carrying stores and provisions to the troops) killed two of them, wounded several, took six prisoners, shot five horses, and took possession of all their arms, stores, provisions, &c., without any loss on our side; among those who were killed was a Lieutenant, who went with the provisions for his recreation, and to view the country, the officer of the guard who generally attends on such occasions being only a serjant. --The enemy having halted one or two hours at Lexington, found it necessary to make a second retreat, carrying with them many of their dead and wounded, who they put into chaises and on horses that they found standing in the road. They continued their retreat from Lexington to Charlestown with great precipitation; and notwithstanding their field pieces, our people continued the pursuit, firing at them until they got to Charlestown neck, (which they reached a little after sunset) over which the enemy passed, proceeded up Bunker's Hill, and soon afterwards went into the town, under the protection of the Somerset man of war of seventy-four guns. In Lexington the enemy set fire to Deacon Joseph's Loring's house and barn, Mrs. Mulliken's house and shop, and Mr. Joshua Ind's house and shop, which were all consumed. The also set fire to several other houses, but our people extinguished the flames. They pillaged almost every house they passed by, breaking and destroying doors, windows, glasses, &c., and carrying off clothing and other valuable effects. it appeared to be their design to burn and destroy all before them; and nothing but our vigorous pursuit prevented their infernal purposes from being put in execution. But the savage barbarity exercised upon the bodies of our unfortunate brethren who fell, is almost incredible. Not content with shooting down the unarmed, aged, and infirm, they disregarded the cries of the wounded, killed them without mercy, and mangling their bodies in the most shocking manner. We have the pleasure to say that notwithstanding the highest provocations given by the enemy, not one instance of cruelty, that we have heard of was committed by our victorious militia; but, listened to the merciful dictates of the christian religion, they ""breathed higher sentiments of humanity."" By an account of the loss of the enemy, said to have come from an officer of one of the men of war, it appears that sixty-three of the regulars, and forty-nine marines were killed, and one hundred and three of both wounded : In all two hundred and fifteen. Lieut. Gould, of the fourth regiment, who is wounded, and Lieut. Potter, of the marines, and about twelve soldiers, are prisoners. Mr. James Howard and one of the regulars discharged their pieces at the same instant, and each killed the other. The public most sincerely sympathize with the friends, and relations of our deceased brethren, who gloriously sacrificed their lives in fighting for the liberties of their country. By their noble, intrepid conduct, in helping to defeat the forces of an ungrateful Tyrant, they have endeared their memories to the present generation, who will transmit their virtues down to the latest posterity. The above account is the best we have been able to obtain. We can only add, that the town of Boston is now invested by a vast army of our brave countrymen, who have flown to our assistance from all quarters. GOD grant them assistance in the extirpation of our cruel and unnatural enemies. SALEM, May 5. ON the nineteenth of April, was killed among others, by the British troops, at Menotomy, as he was courageously defending his country's rights, the good, the pious, and friendly MR. DANIEL TOWNSEND, of Lynn-End. He was a constant and ready friend to the poor and afflicted; a good adviser in case of difficulty, and an able, mild, and sincere reprover of those who were out of the way. In short, he was a friend to his country, a blessing to society, and an ornament to the church of which he was a member. He has left an amiable consort, and five young children, to bewail the loss. Lie, valiant Townsend, in the peaceful shades. --We trust Immortal honors mingle with thy dust. What! tho' thy body struggled in the gore; So did thy Savior's body long before! And as he rais'd his own, by power divine;} So the same power shall also quicken thine,} And in eternal glory mayst thou shine.} On Thursday the twentieth past, the bodies of eleven of the unfortunate persons who fell in the battle, were collected together and buried at Medford. And on Friday the bodies of Messrs. Henry Jacobs, Samuel Cook, Ebenezer Goldthwait, George Southwick, Benjamin Daland, Jun. Jotham Webb, and Perley Putnam, of Danvers, who were likewise slain fighting in the GLORIOUS CAUSE OF LIBERTY AND THEIR COUNTRY, on the nineteenth of April, were respectfully interred among their friends in the different parishes belonging to that town, their corpse being attended to the place of interment by two companies of minute-men from this place, and a large concourse of people from this and the neighboring towns; previous to that interment, an excellent and well adapted prayer was delivered by the Rev. Mr. Holt, of that place. Same day, the remains of Messrs. Azel Porter and Daniel Thompson, of Woburn, who also fell victims to tyranny, were decently interred at that place, attended to the grave by a multitude of persons who assembled on the occasion from that and the neighboring towns: Before they were interred, a very suitable sermon and prayer was delivered by the Rev. Mr. Sherman. Captain Thomas Knights, of the fifth regiment, died at Boston the next day after the engagement, of his wounds he received in the same. He was greatly regretted being esteemed one of the best officers among the King's troops. Lieut. Hull, of the regulars, died of his wounds on Wednesday last at the provincial hospital: His remains were next day conveyed to Charlestown, attended by a company of provincials, and several officers of distinction, and there delivered to the order of General Gage. Twenty-three wounded soldiers lately died at the Castle. Lieutenant Hawkshaw was wounded in the cheek, and it is tho't will not recover. Lieutenant Gore was wounded in the arm: About 12 other officers are wounded. We can assure the public, from the best authority, that our brethren, of all the colonies which we can yet have heard from, are firm and unshaken in their attachment to the common cause of America; and that they are now ready, with their lives and fortunes, to assist us in defeating the cruel designs of our implacable enemies. We have received no particulars of the transactions between General Gage and the inhabitants of Boston. It is certain that the people have delivered up their arms; very few of them have, however been permitted to leave the town, notwithstanding the promise of the General.

AID me ye nine! my muse assist, A sad tale to relate, When such a number of brave men Met their unhappy fate. At Lexington they met their foe Completely all equipp'd, Their guns & swords made glit'ring show, But their base schemes were nipp'd. Americans, go drop a tear Where your slain brethren lay! O! mourn and sympathize for them! O! weep this very day! What shall we say to this loud call From the Almighty sent? It surely bids both great and small Seek GOD's face and repent. Words can't express the ghastly scene That here presents to view, When forty of our brave countrymen Sure bid their friends adieu. O! think how awful it must seem, To hear widows relent Their husbands and their children Who to their graves were sent. The tender babes, nay those unborn, O! dismal cruel death! To snatch their fondest parents dear And leave them thus bereft. O! Lexington! your loss is great! Alas! too great to tell; But justice bids me to relate What to you has befell. Ten of your hardy, bravest sons, Some in their prime did fall; May we no more hear noise of guns, To terrify us all. Let's not forget the Danvers race, So late in battle slain, Their valor and their courage shown, Upon this crimson'd plain. Seven of your youthful sprightly sons In the fierce fight were slain, O! may your loss be all made up, And prove a lasting gain. Cambridge and Medford's loss is great, Though not like Acton's town, Where three fierce military sons Met their untimely doom. Menotomy and Charlestown met A sore and heavy stroke, In losing five of their towsmen Who fell by a tyrant's yoke. Unhappy Lynn and Beverly, Your loss I do bemoan, Five your brave sons in dust doth lie, Who late were in the bloom. Bedford, Woburn, Sudbury, all, Have suffer'd most severe, You miss five of your choicest chore, On them let's drop a tear. Concord, your Captain's fate rehearse, His loss is felt severe, Come, brethren, join with me in verse, His mem'ry hence revere. O! 'Squire Gardiner's death we feel, And sympathizing mourn, Let's drop a tear when it we tell, And view his hapless urn. We sore regret poor Pierce's death, A stroke to Salem known, Whose tears did flow from every brow, When the sad tidings come. The groans of wounded, dying men, Would melt the stoutest soul, O! how it strikes thro' every vein, My flesh and blood runs cold. May all prepare to meet their fate At GOD's tribunal bar, And may war's terrible alarm, For death us not prepare. Your country calls you far and near, America's sons awake, Your helmet, buckler, and your spear, The LORD's own arm now make. His shield will keep us from all harm, Tho' thousands 'gainst us rise, His buckler we must sure put on, If we would win the prize.","1775","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","1 broadside ; 39 x 50 cm.","","","","","Bloody butchery","","","","","From E.

This is unfortunate as our understanding of how Congress performs and has evolved over time is directly linked to how its elected representatives reach and maintain office. In an effort to better understand early U.S. House elections, we revisit the era of the “partisan press” where newspapers were the main source of news for American voters and were typically operated by one of the two major parties. Using a data set linking the geographic location of partisan newspapers with electoral data during the early 19th century, we examine district-specific factors impacting the competitiveness of House races. We uncover previously unidentified evidence of candidate-specific effects during this historical era along with confirmation of media influence in the context of early American elections.","2014","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-01-16 17:34:06","760-783","","5","42","","American Politics Research","Candidates","","","","","","","","","","","","apr.sagepub.com","","00001","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\6QSG85MM\Carson_Hood_2014_Candidates, Competition, and the Partisan Press Congressional Elections in the.pdf; C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\6BCRX86V\760.html","","#AmericanRevolution","Antebellum Era; congressional elections; partisan press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BPBTQRJL","webpage","2006","Byrnes, Sholto","Bizarre political parties: The Boston Tea Party","New Statesman","","","","http://www.newstatesman.com/node/165620","One of the world's newest political parties was formed in Portland, America, in July this year. The Boston Tea Party may sound like a joke, although it has a long way to go to rival some of the sillier names chosen by fringe or non-serious parties, but its founders claim earnest intent. At the Libertarian Party's (LP) annual conference, the Boston Tea Party's founder Thomas Knapp criticised the LP for ""abdication of its political responsibilities"", saying that ""Americans deserve and desperately need a pro-freedom party that forcefully advocates libertarian solutions to the issues of today"". Reactions to the new party, which favours withdrawal from Iraq, repeal of the Patriot Act and an end to the war on marijuana, have been mixed. Postings on the Third Party Watch blog have varied from: ""Enjoy your tea"" to ""This is what destroyed the socialist movement"", and ""I'm still waiting for someone to form the Anarchy Party. Then a few years later disgruntled anarchists will break off and form the Anarchy Reform Caucus"". The Libertarian Party has regularly won approximately one million votes in nationwide US elections, so some have been quick to condemn Knapp. Others are dismissive. ""I predict this Boston Tea Party,"" states one blogger, ""will not, at any point, have any impact on anything"".","2006","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-01-21","","","","","","","Bizarre political parties","","","","","","","","","Online Magazine","","","","","00000","","","","#AmericanRevolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BYU4ILC4","book","2006","Bourne, Russell","Cradle of violence: how Boston's waterfront mobs ignited the American Revolution","","9780471675518 (cloth)","","","","Their spontaneous uprisings and violent actions steered America toward resistance to the Acts of Parliament and finally toward revolution. They tarred and feathered the backsides of British customs officials, gutted the mansion of Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson, armed themselves with marline spikes and cudgels to fight on the waterfront against soldiers of the British occupation, and hurled the contents of 350 chests of British East India Company tea into Boston Harbor under the very guns of the anchored British fleet. Cradle of Violence introduces the maritime workers who ignited the American Revolution: the fishermen desperate to escape impressment by Royal Navy press gangs, the frequently unemployed dockworkers, the wartime veterans and starving widows--all of whose mounting ""tumults"" led the way to rebellion. These were the hard-pressed but fiercely independent residents of Boston's North and South Ends who rallied around the Liberty Tree on Boston Common, who responded to Samuel Adams's cries against ""Tyranny,"" and whose headstrong actions helped embolden John Hancock to sign the Declaration of Independence. Without the maritime mobs' violent demonstrations against authority, the politicians would not have spurred on to utter their impassioned words; Great Britain would not have been provoked to send forth troops to quell the mob-induced rebellion; the War of Independence would not have happened. One of the mobs' most telling demonstrations brought about the Boston Massacre. After it, John Adams attempted to calm the town by dismissing the waterfront characters who had been killed as ""a rabble of saucy boys, negroes and mulattoes, Irish teagues, and outlandish jack tars."" Cradle of Violence demonstrates that they were, more truly, America's first heroes.","2006","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","xiii, 272 p. : ill., maps ; 25 cm.","","","","","Cradle of violence","","","","","John Wiley & Sons","Hoboken, N.J.","English","","","Copac","","Jisc","","00000","","","","United States -- History -- Revolution, 1775-1783 -- Causes.; United States -- History -- Revolution, 1775-1783 -- Social aspects.; Boston (Mass.) -- History -- Revolution, 1775-1783.; Boston (Mass.) -- Politics and government -- 1775-1783.; Boston (Mass.) -- Social conditions -- 18th century.; Mobs -- Massachusetts -- Boston -- History -- 18th century.; Mobs -- United States -- Massachusetts -- Boston -- History -- 18th century.; Riots -- Massachusetts -- Boston -- History -- 18th century.; Riots -- United States -- Massachusetts -- Boston -- History -- 18th century.; Violence -- Massachusetts -- Boston -- History -- 18th century.; Violence -- United States -- Massachusetts -- Boston -- History -- 18th century.; #AmericanRevolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"XHRJ4RHL","book","2013","Gould, Philip","Writing the Rebellion: Loyalists and the Literature of Politics in British America","","978-0-19-996790-2","","","","Writing the Rebellion presents a cultural history of loyalist writing in early America. There has been a spate of related works recently, but Philip Goulds narrative offers a completely different view of the loyalist/patriot contentions than appears in any of these accounts. By focusing on the literary projections of the loyalist cause, Gould dissolves the old legend that loyalists were more British than American, and patriots the embodiment of a new sensibility drawn from their American situation and upbringing. He shows that both sides claimed to be heritors of British civil discourse, Old World learning, and the genius of English culture. The first half of Writing Rebellion deals with the ways political disputation spilled into arguments about style, form, and aesthetics, as though these subjects could secure (or ruin) the very status of political authorship. Chapters in this section illustrate how loyalists attack patriot rhetoric by invoking British satires of an inflated Whig style by Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift. Another chapter turns to Loyalist critiques of Congressional language and especially the Continental Association, which was responsible for radical and increasingly violent measures against the Loyalists. The second half of Goulds book looks at satiric adaptations of the ancient ballad tradition to see what happens when patriots and loyalists interpret and adapt the same text (or texts) for distinctive yet related purposes. The last two chapters look at the Loyalist response to Thomas Paines Common Sense and the ways the concept of the author became defined in early America. Throughout the manuscript, Gould acknowledges the purchase English literary culture continued to have in revolutionary America, even among revolutionaries.","2013-05-10","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","230","","","","","Writing the Rebellion","","","","","Oxford University Press","Oxford","en","","","","","Google Books","","00000","","","https://books.google.ie/books?id=uiZpAgAAQBAJ","#AmericanRevolution","History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800); Literary Criticism / American / General; Literary Criticism / Renaissance; History / United States / Colonial Period (1600-1775)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In her opinion, writers like Thomas Paine and early theorists of the abolitionist movements constituted ‘magical moments’ of Enlightenment reform, but especially the revolutionary election of 1800 ended much of this enthusiasm. The Enlightenment individual was after all an abstract one and represented the common good more than true difference. As a consequence, the right to self-ownership was contrasted with the right to protect one’s property, and slave-owners could refer to liberalism in order to justify the possession of another human being. Most of the ‘Northern Coalition’ men generally imagined a white state and were especially worried about mixed families and racial fusion as signs of political instability. This ‘collective sameness’ or ‘homogenous politics’, however, failed to include those who embodied difference. This fundamental failure to associate rights with difference had long-term effects on the educational system and social structure.","2003","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","xxii, 484 pages : illustrations, ports. ; 25 cm","","","","","This violent empire","","","","","Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture/University of North Carolina Press","Chapel Hill","English","","","","","","","00000","","","","United States -- Civilization -- 1783-1865.; Violence -- United States -- History -- 18th century.; Difference (Psychology) -- Political aspects -- United States -- History -- 18th century.; Marginality, Social -- United States -- History -- 18th century.; Men, White -- United States -- Attitudes -- History -- 18th century.; National characteristics, American -- History -- 18th century.; Paranoia -- United States -- History -- 18th century.; Political culture -- United States -- History -- 18th century.; Racism -- United States -- History -- 18th century.; Sexism -- United States -- History -- 18th century.; #AmericanRevolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BJUMXH2T","book","2016","Nagy, John A.","George Washington's Secret Spy War: The Making of America's First Spymaster","","978-1-250-09682-1","","","","George Washington was America’s first spymaster, and his skill as a spymaster won the war for independence.George Washington’s Secret Spy War is the untold story of how George Washington took a disorderly, ill-equipped rabble and defeated the best trained and best equipped army of its day in the Revolutionary War. Author John A. Nagy has become the nation’s leading expert on the subject, discovering hundreds of spies who went behind enemy lines to gather intelligence during the American Revolution, many of whom are completely unknown to most historians. Using George Washington’s diary as the primary source, Nagy tells the story of Washington’s experiences during the French and Indian War and his first steps in the field of espionage. Despite what many believe, Washington did not come to the American Revolution completely unskilled in this area of warfare. Espionage was a skill he honed during the French and Indian war and upon which he heavily depended during the Revolutionary War. He used espionage to level the playing field and then exploited it on to final victory. Filled with thrilling and never-before-told stories from the battlefield and behind enemy lines, this is the story of how Washington out-spied the British. For the first time, readers will discover how espionage played a major part in the American Revolution and why Washington was a master at orchestrating it.","2016","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","385","","","","","George Washington's Secret Spy War","","","","","St. Martin's Press","New York","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: uDinCwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.de/books?id=uDinCwAAQBAJ","#AmericanRevolution","History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800); Political Science / Intelligence & Espionage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"3TEKZJDU","book","2012","Unger, Harlow","American Tempest: How the Boston Tea Party Sparked a Revolution","","978-0-306-81976-6","","","","On Thursday, December 16, 1773, an estimated seven dozen men, many dressed as Indians, dumped roughly £10,000 worth of tea in Boston Harbor. Whatever their motives at the time, they unleashed a social, political, and economic firestorm that would culminate in the Declaration of Independence two-and-a-half years later. The Boston Tea Party provoked a reign of terror in Boston and other American cities as tea parties erupted up and down the colonies. The turmoil stripped tens of thousands of their homes and property, and nearly 100,000 left forever in what was history's largest exodus of Americans from America. Nonetheless, John Adams called the Boston Tea Party nothing short of ""magnificent,"" saying that ""it must have important consequences."" Combining stellar scholarship with action-packed history, Harlow Giles Unger reveals the truth behind the legendary event and examines its lasting consequence--the spawning of a new, independent nation","2012","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","306","","","","","American Tempest","","","","","Da Capo Press","New York","en","","","","","Google Books","","00000","","","https://books.google.de/books?id=Y4UVXXLGxNAC","#AmericanRevolution","History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800); History / United States / Colonial Period (1600-1775)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

John Marshall says fundamental law, not as the alloy of compromise Alexander Hamilton intended ""merely to regulate the general political interests of the nation,"" but as the puritanical fulfillment in law of the Paulist prescription ""to come out among them and be separate."" As Marshall admonished, ""if a law be in opposition to the constitution, if both the law and the constitution apply to a particular case,"" the resolution must conform to the ""constitution disregarding the law."" This is the accepted and universally acclaimed meaning of breaking the law in America. Yet as Socrates rhetorically inquired, and the Framers dogmatically insisted, whence could a constitution derive if not from the self, ""what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections of human nature?"" If it is also true that ""justice is the end of government . . . the end of civil society,"" so it must also be in the beginning of man in man, his self-recognition as just. The Constitution, thus framed, is the latter-day mirror in which every man sees himself as ""paramount"" justice, privileged no less than John Marshall, to say what the law is for himself and against all others.","2007","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-01-21 17:18:53","471-512","","3","19","","Law and Literature","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","00003","","","","#AmericanRevolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NCRVDNUP","webpage","2007","The New York Public Library's Online Exhibition Archive","Selections from the C.W. McAlpin Collection. Section IV. Fictitious Portraits of Washington","From Revolution to Republic in Prints and Drawings","","","","http://web-static.nypl.org/exhibitions/revolution/selection4.html","General Washington’s fame reached Europe before any accurate portraits of him did. Lacking any examples of his actual appearance, foreign publishers commissioned fictitious portraits. As early as 1775, publishers in London were already issuing prints of American Revolutionaries that bore no resemblance to the men themselves. These prints then served as models for printmakers elsewhere in Europe. In a similar vein, some American printmakers who had access to reproductions of life portraits chose not to copy them faithfully, but to use them simply as a starting point for decorative or allegorical creations.   Anonymous (British, 18th century) after “Alexander Campbell” George Washington, Esqr. General and Commander in Chief of the Continental Army in America Mezzotint and line engraving [London]: C. Shepherd, 1775 The publisher of this fictitious representation of Washington claimed a fraudulent attribution in order to give it a sense of authenticity. The inscription “Done from an Original, Drawn from the Life by Alexr. Campbell of Williamsburgh in Virginia” is entirely false. No such artist is known to have existed, and Washington himself denied having ever met Campbell, let alone posing for him. With good humor Washington declared in a letter: “Mr. Campbell, whom I never saw to my knowledge, has made a very formidable figure of the Commander-in-Chief, giving him a sufficient portion of terror in his countenance.” This print, along with a three-quarter–length portrait of Washington by “Campbell,” was widely circulated in Europe, inspiring many copies and variations, including the following print by Johann Martin Will.   Johann Martin Will (German, 1727–1806) George Washington, Esqr. General and Comander of the Continental Army in America Engraving and etching with hand-coloring Augsburg, ca. 1775–81 Will clearly based this representation of Washington on the fictitious equestrian portrait by “Campbell.” For his version, published in Germany, Will included an inscription in French and German that appears to taunt Great Britain and question that country’s prospect of victory over the colonies.   Anonymous (French, 18th century) George Washington Ecuyer Général de l’Armée Anglo-amériquaine nommé Dictateur par le Congrès en Fevr. 1777; George Washington Ecuyr. Général and Commander en Chief of the Continental Army in America Engraving and etching Paris: Crepy, ca. 1777–81 Charles Henry Hart likened this print to portraits of William III (1650–1702), King of England, Scotland, and Ireland (r. 1689–1702). It certainly bears more resemblance to equestrian portraits of European monarchs of that period than to Washington or any of his contemporaries. The inscription states that Washington was nominated as ruler by Congress in February 1777. In fact, he was selected by Congress as commander in chief in June 1775, and elected president by the electoral college in April 1789. February 6, 1778, marked the date of France’s alliance with the United States.   Attributed to John Norman (English, ca. 1748–1817; active in the United States ca. 1774–1817) The True Portraiture of His Excellency George Washington Esqr. in the Roman Dress, as Ordered by Congress for the Monument to Be Erected in Philadelphia, to Perpetuate to Posterity the Man Who Commanded the American Forces Through the Late Glorious Revolution Engraving and etching, ca. 1783 Although a representation of Washington in 16th-century European armor may seem laughable, this print, as evidenced by the inscription, was inspired by a commission by the Continental Congress. In 1783, shortly before the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Congress voted unanimously to erect an equestrian statue of Washington and, according to its Journal of August 7, decided “That the statue be of bronze: The General to be represented in a Roman dress, holding a truncheon in his right hand, and his head encircled with a laurel wreath.” Norman, if he was in fact the author, based the head on Charles Willson Peale’s 1776 portrait of Washington (on view here in a mezzotint attributed to Joseph Hiller). His solution for “Roman dress” was a figure in armor that he copied, along with the background battle scene, directly from an engraving by William de la More in John Guillam’s Display of Heraldry, a 1724 edition of which was in the possession of Norman’s acquaintance John Coles, Sr. Armor is also a timeless symbol of military strength, and therefore emblematic of Washington’s prowess as general.   Attributed to Paul Revere (American, 1735–1818) His Excellency George Washington, Esq; Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States of America Relief print, [1780] Charles Willson Peale’s 1776 painting was the first life portrait of Washington to be copied in American prints, and it was done so extensively, beginning with the mezzotint attributed to Joseph Hiller, also on view here. These copies, many only vaguely reminiscent of the original painting, appeared in numerous books, almanacs, and primers. In this print, which first appeared in a 1781 almanac and subsequently in a number of New England primers of the 1780s and 1790s, the Washington portrait has been greatly simplified as a little decorative relief cut for insertion in the text. It was probably engraved from type metal by Paul Revere, the Boston silversmith, printer, and Revolutionary. Revere based the image on an engraving for the 1780 Philadelphia almanac by John Norman, which in turn was based on Peale’s portrait.","2007","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","","","","","","Selections","","","","","","","English","","exhibition review / selection","","","","","00000","","","","portraits; George Washington; #AmericanRevolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As Washington accused Gage of treating captivated American officers unduely, Gage responded on August 13, 1775: ""To the glory of civilized nations, humanity and war have been compatible, and compassion to the subdued is become almost a general system. Britons, ever pre-eminent in mercy, have outgone common examples, and overlooked the criminal in the captive. Upon these principles your prisoners, whose lives by the law of the land are destined to the cord, have hitherto been treated with care and kindness, and more comfortably lodged than the King's troops in the hospitals; indiscriminately it is true, for I acknowledge no rank that is not derived from the King. My intelligence from your army would justify severe recrimination. I understand there are of the King's faithful subjects, taken some time since by the rebels, labouring like Negro slaves, to gain their daily subsistence, or reduced to the wretched alternative, to perish by famine, or take arms against their King and Country. THose who have made the Treatment of the prisoners in my Hand, or of your other friends in Boston, a pretence for such measures, found barbarity on falsehood. I would willingly hope, Sir, that the Sentiments of liberality, which I have always believed you to possess, will be exerted to correct these misdoings: be temperate in political disquisition: give free Operation to truth, and punish those who deceive and misrepresent, and no only the effects, but the causes, of this unhappy conflict will be removed.

The Continental Congress have published an address to the People of Ireland, containign some severe strictures on the mode of governing, adopted in Britain at the conclusion of the last war.","Chester Chronicle, Or Commercial Intelligencer","","","","","This address is not quoted in Detail but Shows how eager Congress was at the beginning of the Revolutionary War to find solidarity among other disadvantaged British citizens. The tone is pathetic: ""We already anticipate the golden period, when liberty, with all the gentle arts of peace and humanity, shall establish her mild dominion in this western world; and erect eternal monuments to the Memory of those virtuous patriots and martyrs, who shall have fought, bled, and suffered in her cause"". The atmosphere of Retaliation and patriotism on both sides makes us wonder how Congress could still Claim that they didn't aspire Independence. At the same time, it becomes obvious that most Americans didn't really see a clear constitutional alternative to the existing system. And above all, North America lacked a comprehensive Vision of future foreign policy. This is why their Appeals to colonies outside North America soon subsided. Nevertheless, their words to the Irish of 1775 are strong: ""We sympathize with you in your distress and are pleased to find that the design of subjugating us, has persuaded Administration to Dispense to Ireland some vagrant rays of ministerial sunshine - Even the tender mercies of government have been Long cruel towards you - In the rich pastures of Ireland, many hungry parricides have fed and grown strong to labour in ist destruction - We hope the Patient abiding of the meek may not always be forgotten; and God grant that the iniquitous schemes of extirpating liberty from the British empire may be soon defeated. (...) For the achievement of this happy Event, we confide in the good Offices of our fellow-subjects beyond the Atlantic."" The Newspaper continues to state without another Headline: ""Yesterday upwards of one thousand letters from Boston were delivered at the General Post-Office, with near two thousand from the East Indies. A correspondent, who declares himself impartial, thinks the American war in the nature of it must be Long and bloody; the colonists conceive they are fighting for their liberties, and Great Britain is contending for national superiority; both parties have lost sight of the original quarrel, nor are either very attentive to consequences; the sword is drawn, and will not be sheathed while America prefers liberty to life, and the honour and dignity of Great Britain remain cant words at St. James's.""

To Sir George Warren","The Morning Post, and Daily Advertiser","","","","","The ""Morning Post"" largely defends government policy and is particularly critical of inner-British Opposition, e.g. John Wilkes.  The author who calls himself the ""Political Looking-Glass"" writes: ""Already, Sir, we have lamentable proof, how far the prejudices of a few men of abilities and power extend, over a weak and deluded People. (...) Sir, when we come to consider, that the prejudieces and passions of mankind often are inflamed and flow like a tumultuous Tide, hurried away by every equinoxious (?) gust, and in this Country more than any other, where freedom is the wide boundary, and every species of licentiousness reigns unchecked, under the veil of liberty; every settled form of government becomes a load, and variety, as to the prostitute, becomes a charm to every republican and factious Spirit; (...) yet there is a period, when the understanding Everts to the brain, when prejudices subside, and then no People under heaven, have a clearer view, or a more forcible understanding than Britons. (...) To oppose a principle of virtue and loyalty, to the current of faction and Opposition, in these degenerate days, Displays a man fool-hardy in the act of Applause. (...) speak in the Senate-house, tear up the roots of the legislature, dismember the empire of its largest and most profitable wing, shape your Argument to inflame, and upon it hangs all the delicious fruit of popular Applause, spirited Argument, and seasoned declamation. (...) you have brought to the legislature a reinforcement more formidable against America, than legions of British soldiers; the concurrent voice of the People are the strenght of a nation. Upon that promised idea of Division at home, America grew formidable; London Held up the Monster, and smaller town, under her influence trembled at the hedious Cyclops. But Sir, when Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Hull, Lancaster, Leicester, shew a praise-worthy example to their beloved King and Country, when Britons behold their interests, their credit, and honour, at stake, when they behold their Navigation laws tore away, the foundation of our Commercial intercourse and Advantage with America, and her trade Extended over Europe; when they see a rebellious army, fanatically mad, opposing the undenied power of the British legislature, can ther be a nuterlift (?), can there be a Briton who will not take an active part? (...) Such, SIr, is the duty of every Representative of County, City and borough, to recommend to his constituents; and were London not pathetically cursed by the jurisdiction fo men, who Sport with the liberties and honour of citizens, to Support their designs, it would erect a Monument of fame, duty, and loyalty, by a proper and suitable address at this juncture. A general ülan of this Kind, Sir, would, restore to us the Blessings of concord, it would cancel the bellious and petulent voice of faction, and leave our Senate undistrubed by the roaring of hungry vultures, for that Portion of plunder, which they expected from the discontent of the People.""","1775","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","[not paged]","","Friday, September 22","907","","","For the Morning Post","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","http://find.galegroup.com/bncn/","","","","#AmericanRevolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It shows how soldiers worked alongside the civilian authorities to suppress the disturbances, and how the militarized response was composed of militiamen, volunteers, and vigilantes, as well as regulars. This serves to emphasize the overlaps between the military and civil spheres, and shows how the figure of the ‘citizen soldier’ had a key role in the ideology and practice of policing. This, in turn, suggests that we need to rethink how we conceive of ‘supporting the civil power’ within the English police tradition.","2012","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2016-01-21 15:00:28","27-41","","1","37","","","Supporting the Civil Power","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","00002","","C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\ACA73FMD\McCormack_2012_Supporting the Civil Power.pdf; C:\Users\mobarget\Zotero\storage\765WJTI5\174963212X13296107765954.html","","#GordonRiots","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Even though the book focusses on modern events like the Good Friday Agreement, it also raises some timeless questions of Republicanism and its tendencies towards left or right. The argument that Republicanism has always been threatened by class struggles is closely related to historical debates on conservatism and revolutionary potential in the works of James Sack and Isaac Kramnick.","2005","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","135","","","","","Ireland","","","","","Wellred Publications","London","English","","","","","Copac","","","","","","Ireland; History; philosophy; Great Britian; political participation; Political science; #IrishRebellion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"C9CPU398","book","2010","Bartlett, Thomas","Ireland: A History","","978-0-521-19720-5","","","","Ireland has rarely been out of the news during the past thirty years. Whether as a war-zone in which Catholic nationalists and Protestant Unionists struggled for supremacy, a case study in conflict resolution or an economy that for a time promised to make the Irish among the wealthiest people on the planet, the two Irelands have truly captured the world's imagination. Yet single-volume histories of Ireland are rare. Here, Thomas Bartlett, one of the country's leading historians, sets out a fascinating new history that ranges from prehistory to the present. Integrating politics, society and culture, he offers an authoritative historical road map that shows exactly how - and why - Ireland, north and south, arrived at where it is today. This is an indispensable guide to both the legacies of the past for Ireland's present and to the problems confronting north and south in the contemporary world.","2010","2020-06-03 15:33:34","2020-06-03 15:33:34","","","643","","","","","Ireland","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","en","","","","","Google Books","","00039","","","https://books.google.ie/books?id=nL1q1ijut8gC","#IrishRebellion","History / Europe / Great Britain; History / Europe / Ireland","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"NJDKL5FW","book","2008","Depreux, Philippe","Revolte und Sozialstatus von der Spätantike bis zur Frühen Neuzeit: Révolte et statut social de l'Antiquité tardive aux Temps modernes","","3-486-58584-3","","","","Tagungsbericht: http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/termine/id=4468 Veranstalter: Mission historique française en Allemagne (Göttingen) in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Deutschen Historischen Institut (Paris) Datum, Ort: 24.10.2005-25.10.2005, Paris, Deutsches Historisches Institut Die Revolten und aufrührerischen Bewegungen wurden bisher vor allem unter zwei Aspekten analysiert: Zum einen ging es um den marxistischen Ansatz des Klassenkampfes, der bekräftigt oder widerlegt werden sollte – besonders wenn die Beweggründe vorwiegend ökonomischer Natur waren –; zum anderen sollte die Analyse der Untersuchung der Machtausübung dienen, meist handelte es sich dabei um Fälle der Anfechtung der Macht einer Person und seltener um die Nichtanerkennung eines Systems. Die Frage nach der sozialen Schichtung und der Mobilität innerhalb der gesellschaftlichen Hierarchie – genauer nach dem gesellschaftlichen Auf- und Absteigen der Eliten – wird oft als Forschungsobjekt angesprochen, steht aber nur selten im Zentrum der historischen Reflexion. Die französische Geschichtsschreibung hat sich besonders den „Problèmes de stratification sociale“ (so der Titel des Kolloquiums, das 1966 von R. Mousnier organisiert wurde) im Kontext von Revolten zugewandt – aber der Frage nach der sozialen Schichtung und der sozialen Mobilität wurde noch nicht umfassend in einer eigenen, vergleichenden Untersuchung nachgegangen. Eine epochenüberschreitende Untersuchung dieser Fragestellung, von der Spätantike bis zur Neuzeit, soll daher das Ziel dieses Treffens sein (obwohl die „bürgerliche“ Französische Revolution in exemplarischer Weise illustriert, welche Bedeutung der soziale Rang der Beteiligten in Bezug auf die Einflussnahme auf den Verlauf der Dinge und auf den daraus für sie resultierenden Gewinn hatte, soll die Revolutionszeit, angesichts der tiefgreifenden Veränderungen der politischen Werte, die daraus resultierten, hier nicht behandelt werden). Die Aufständischen, denen dieses Treffen sich zuwendet, wollten nicht die Welt verändern, sondern vor allem, als Reaktion auf eine Entwicklung, die sie ihrer vermeintlichen oder tatsächlichen Rechte beraubte, ihre Lebensbedingungen schützen. Dabei gilt das Interesse nicht in erster Linie den ökonomischen Beweggründen dieser „Primitive Rebels“ (E. Hobsbawm), sondern dem Aufkommen der neuen Eliten (im von V. Pareto definierten Sinne: die Besten in ihrer Kategorie, unabhängig von jeglichem Urteil über den Wert der Kategorie), das sich durch die Revolte zeigt – oder zeigen kann –, vor allem in Bezug auf die möglichen Interessenkonflikte zwischen den regierenden und den nicht regierenden Eliten. Es geht also nicht um die Revolte als Auslöser für eine Veränderung, sondern als Phänomen der Entwicklung der allgemeinen sozialen Beziehungen und der Auswirkung des Sozialstatus’ insbesondere auf die Beteiligung an der Macht. Es soll daher ausgeleuchtet werden, was die Spezifität bestimmter Eliten (ökonomische, soziale, politische) ausmacht, in Hinblick auf ihre Auflehnung (oder ihre Ablehnung dieser Vorgehensweise) und der Formen, die diese annehmen konnte, und in Bezug auf die Werturteile über die Durchführung des Aufstandes, welche von der Personalität der Protagonisten abhängen, aber auch bezogen auf das Bewusstsein, der Elite anzugehören (oder nicht anzugehören). Gleich auf zweifache Weise fließt der Begriff des Sozialstatus’ in die Untersuchung des Phänomens des Aufstandes ein: bei der Beurteilung der Aufständischen insgesamt und bei der Einschätzung ihrer Anführer. Die Idee der „sozialen Anerkennung“ ist hier entscheidend: Inwiefern decken sich die Urteile der Zeitgenossen und die Analyse der Historiker in Bezug auf die Wahrnehmung des Sozialstatus’ der Aufständischen und ihrer Anführer (und dessen Auswirkung auf die Durchführung des Aufstandes)? Inwieweit bedingt (oder erlaubt) ein bestimmter Sozialstatus die Anwendung einer bestimmten Form der Revolte? Läßt der Aufstand das Entstehen einer neuen Elite erkennen, sei es eine in sich abgeschlossene soziale Gruppe (z. B. eine Schwurgemeinschaft) oder seien es Persönlichkeiten innerhalb dieser Gruppe? Ist durch einen Aufstand ein wirklicher (dauerhafter) sozialer Aufstieg möglich? Inwiefern verstärkt die Unterdrückung der Revolte die sozialen Unterschiede? Für wen gilt die „Pflicht zum Aufstand“ oder „devoir de révolte“ (A. Jouanna, in Bezug auf den französischen Adel im 16. und 17. Jh.) und wem ist ein Aufstand verboten (anders ausgedrückt: Wo liegt die Grenze zwischen Subversion und Ausschließung) – und warum? Es soll versucht werden, Antworten auf diese Fragen zu finden, ausgehend von der römischen Welt der Spätantike und ihrer Weiterentwicklung im byzantinischen Reich bis zu den Vergleichen mit den fernöstlichen Gesellschaften. Nach dem Studium der Analysemöglichkeiten, die die frühmittelalterlichen Quellen (zu politischen und monastischen Eliten) bieten, soll es um die Kommunalaufstände gehen, die die Geschichte des 11. und 12. Jahrhunderts in Frankreich und Italien wesentlich bestimmt haben. Besser dokumentiert sind die Revolten (bäuerliche und städtische) des Hoch- und Spätmittelalters und die ökonomischen und politischen (unter dem Vorwand der Konfessionalisation?) Wirren der frühen Neuzeit: Es sollen mehrere regionale Studien vorgestellt werden, um damit, jenseits des deutsch-französischen Dialoges, eine internationale Reflexion zu einer Frage anzustoßen, die sich besonders gut für einen Vergleich der verschiedenen Methoden der historischen Analyse eignet.
