All main actors in riot were their followers who led many carmen, link-boys and newspaper-cryers who pulled down the stage when poll began. Mob refused to obey sheriffs, beat off one party of the main guard and attacked a second. Afterwards forced candidates who are present MPs and others to escape over wall. Active in the riot was Mr Harvey, 'servant to the lord chancellor'; we were defeated by two votes in attempt to get that phrase removed from motion. By another motion, commons succeeded in pre-empting lords in getting hold of papers relating to mayoral elections in town clerk's hands.",
    "Results":"Resolutions of house of commons. No sheriff, mayor or chief magistrate has right to vote in election, except where casting vote, or where right allowed by charter or customary usage. Mr Brodrick reported from committee on proceedings against Edward Lloyd for printing and publishing Memoirs of the Chevalier De St George and Dudley Moore about riot at the Playhouse, leading to six resolutions (listed). Committee appointed to draw up address and house adjourned.",
