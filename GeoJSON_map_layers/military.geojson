    "Agents":"riot at Cockbridge against the swearing and enrolling of ballotted men and substitutes for the [Supplementary] Militia. [The magistrates] had begun the proceedings when the rioters forced their way into the room armed with bludgeons, protesting against any swearing in of militia. Mr Knubley, a fellow magistrate who had put on his hat, was violently struck on the head with a bludgeon, but this was the only violent act they received. The rioters took all the papers and the new testament and burned them on the fire after which they deemed they had done enough, although drinking and confusion prevailed. The landlord advised that the magistrates should forego their dinner there for their own safety and the safety of the house as he had heard that they planned further mischief, and so the magistrates left by horse. Saunderson, the [window tax] surveyor, did not heed the advice and remained. He was rolled in the mud by the rioters and obliged to give them two barrels of ale and made to promise he would charge no more horses to duty. Mr Blennerhassett, High Constable, was also hunted down and would have suffered severely had not some taken pity on him and let him escape. The chief protagonists in this riot were from Bassenthwaite.",
    "Results":"The rioters returned in the late evening when the surveyor was at dinner and forced their way in. A young woman tried to hinder their progress and was thrown over the banisters. She was not injured but caught by people below. Upwards of 400 people were involved but the mischief was perpetrated by about 25, the rest looking passively on. Most of the rioters are known but not all. Satterthwaite states that the swearing in and enrolling at Whitehaven had been adjourned to a later date.",
