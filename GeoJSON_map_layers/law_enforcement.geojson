Forster professed his innocence, but a man [Bone, possibly the arresting officer together with one Inkles and another] 'narrowly escaped with his life in consequence of Captain Forster's direction to the soldiers. Suggestions that the cause of the disturbance was that the constables had been given warrants against an officer.",
    "Results":"The 3 witnesses that appeared in Forster's trial were three constables involved in the dispute at Cowes. At least one of the constables offered to 'keep quiet' for payment. Forster was offered compensation, the money to be paid to the poor, but it appears again his pride got in the way and this was refused, he wanted a public acknowledgement. The charge for which Forster was finally arrested is not stated here but it appears, at some point, Forster was charged with 'assault' [whether by him or by officers under his command is not stated] on the constables and found guilty.",
