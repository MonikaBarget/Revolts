Enclosed are the statements of Richard Harris, W Picker and W Stevenson sworn on 27 July 1798 before Sutton and Becher, magistrates for the Liberty of Southwell. Harris states that Morgan 'was in liquor' and his conversation was about Irish affairs. Morgan had said that no English lord should sit as lord lieutenant for Ireland and that the rebels in Ireland were gentlemen of honour. Harris, in the kitchen of the Saracen's Head , warned him to be careful what he said, at which Morgan told him to mind his own business and one of the soldiers drew his sword. Picker states that Morgan was talking of the Irish business. One of the sergeants then claimed that Picker had said that Morgan was not a gentleman. After an altercation the sergeant struck Picker with his fist then Morgan also struck him. Stevenson states that he was at Mr Mansford's, the Cross Keys , Southwell, when Mr Hinds, an ostler from the Saracen's Head , asked for Buckler, the constable. The constable was not there, but Mansford said that soldiers were fighting. Stevenson ran out and saw Morgan struggling to get out of the house and the soldiers trying to keep him in. Edward Carney, a sergeant, then came out with his sword drawn. He struck Samuel Cooke across the thigh with his sword. Cooke then ran to Mr Mansford's door where James Rogart, Mansford's servant, stood with his back to the wall. The sergeant gave an oath and struck Rogart with his sword with all his might, leaving him bleeding. The sergeant then ran to Mr Little's shop door and the mob ran to get out of his way. He turned and ran after Stevenson who gave him the slip but he struck William Hall with his sword across the shoulder, not wounding him as the sword broke. He then ran after Harris with a sweeping brush when Harris was called upon by the constable to assist him. Cooke then came up to the sergeant and knocked him down. Also enclosed is a note from J Faulkner [surgeon] regarding James Raggart [Rogart] who was wounded in the affray. Raggart's wound is said to be very extensive and the inflammation considerable. Annotated: extract of letter and enclosures sent to Colonel [Robert Brownrigg], [Military Secretary to the Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief].",
