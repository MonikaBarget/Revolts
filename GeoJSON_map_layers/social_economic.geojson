Coke then arrived and arranged a date to hear from the women about their situation, after which the flour was loaded on the ship and the militia were quartered in the town.

Philipps had asked Captain [Stephen Longcroft], Regulating Captain at the port of Milford, to provide an escort for the vessel. Philipps then met a great crowd of men, women and children, armed with wooden clubs, in the main street of Haverfordwest and had advised them to disperse. Mr Bateman, an attorney, and James Summers, his curate, had come to Philipps's aid and beaten off the attackers. Mr Milles of Lincoln's Inn and others came to assist, the Militia were summoned and ordered to load their firearms, and the Riot Act was read, at which the colliers ran off, two being arrested and jailed.",
    "Results":"Without this intervention in the High Street, the colliers would have reached the Quay and the sloop would have been gutted. The sloop sailed that evening with a merchant, a magistrate and 20 militia men on board. [Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knox] had agreed to bring the Fishguard Fencibles to Haverfordwest, allowing the Militia to return to Pembroke. Philipps had released the jailed colliers after they had entered into recognizances for their good behaviour. They had informed him that, had they succeeded in unloading the butter, they intended to seize all the corn at the next market. Philipps understood that the colliers had been encouraged by one or more people of property in Haverfordwest and he suggests an advertisement be placed in the Gazette offering a reward for the discovery of the offenders, ensuring that such advertisement be copied in papers that were read locally such as the Evening Mail , the Sun , the Star and Farley's Bristol Journal.",
