### Interactive map of uprisings

The **interactive map** below is based on events found in print-publications of the eighteenth century as well as Wikidata and Wikipedia between 1500 and 1800. At the moment, the map is very basic and only displays the event names in the pop-up labels. The colour gradation reflects the time: more distant events are shown in darker colours.

Event descriptions (especially information on their outcomes) have mainly been harvested from the **Wikipedia info boxes** and need to be checked carefully in the future. The details can be viewed when <a href="https://github.com/MonikaBarget/Revolts/blob/master/MAP_events.geojson">clicking on the points in the GeoJSON file</a> (containing coordinates for digital mapping). A pop-up window will open for each selected place.

Different **types of events** (e.g. rural uprising and urban riots) cannot be selected at the moment. This will require the tagging of the entire dataset. Although the data are thus far from complete, they showcase the geographic distribution of violent conflict across the early modern British Empire as well as the many overlaps between regional, "inner-state" events and international conflicts involving foreign governments.
